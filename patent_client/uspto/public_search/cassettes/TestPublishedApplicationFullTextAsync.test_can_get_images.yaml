      Double Blinded Privacy-Safe Distributed Data Mining Protocol is disclosed, among
      an aggregator, a data consumer entity having privacy-sensitive information,
      and data source entities having privacy-sensitive information. The aggregator
      does not have access to the privacy-sensitive information at either the data
      consumer entity or the data source entities. The aggregator formulates a query
      without using privacy-sensitive information, and sends the query to the data
      consumer entity. The data consumer entity generates a list of specific instances
      that meet the conditions of the query and sends the list, encrypted, to the
      data source entities either directly or through the aggregator. The data source
      entities match the list against transactional data, de-identify the matched
      results, and send them to the aggregator. The aggregator combines results from
      data source entities and sends the combined result to the data consumer entity.
      This allows for privacy-safe data mining where both the data consumer entity
      and data source entities have privacy-sensitive information not available for
      the aggregator to see or use.","descriptionHtml":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br

      />DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br />[0100] Note: Solely for the sake
      of simplicity--in order that the ordinary man of the art may appreciate the
      unique facility of the instant protocol, the (non-limiting) example of detail
      will be for the health care industry. One reason for this choice is that compliance
      with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is
      a well-known semi-intractable problem that is adequately documented for use
      as an objective metric of the usefulness of the instant invention. Thus, the
      instant example relates to using embodiments of the Protocol of the present
      invention as a computer-implemented method for profiling health programs while
      maintaining participant privacy. (The specific background details related to
      health care information systems are presented in the latter part of the background
      section.)<br />[0101] Simply stated, embodiments of the instant profile are
      computer-implemented for profiling health programs--to assist program planners
      such as marketing managers from pharmaceutical manufacturers or other health
      promotion managers to assess the aggregate behavior of a large group of participants
      impacted by a specific health program compared to a control group. The assessment
      of the impact of a particular program is done by profiling participants aggregate
      objective health transaction data (pharmacy, treatment, diagnosis, lab, etc.)
      to conclude various effects of the health program compared with a possibly defined
      control group while adhering to current and evolving privacy standards and laws
      such as HIPAA.<br />[0102] Objective health transaction data resides within
      healthcare organizations such as health service providers (doctors, hospitals,
      labs, etc.) and health plans (managed care plans, HMOs, PPOs, insurance companies,
      pharmacy benefit managers, self-insured employers, state and federal government
      health benefit programs, etc.). These organizations are governed by a set of
      privacy standards, rules and regulations such as HIPAA and therefore has severe
      limitation in their use of healthcare information that includes identifiable
      personal health information.<br />[0103] Here is an example to use of this instant
      protocol: (Background:) A pharmaceutical company that manufacture a pharmaceutical
      product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has established several health
      programs to encourage consumers of that product to use the product persistently
      and correctly. Such health programs include a Call Center Program staffed by
      nurses who can answer ongoing questions and train consumers on how to use the
      product correctly and a Web-Site Program that includes health management tools
      and access to relevant disease information. These pharmaceutical health programs
      are promoted to consumers of that product who then opt-in to participate in
      the program. The participants of each program allow, among other things, the
      pharmaceutical manufacturer to analyze their data in aggregate. Some of the
      participants of the manufacturer health programs belong to various healthcare
      organizations that aggregate health transactions generated by the consumers
      in their ongoing consumption of healthcare services and products. This health
      transactions data includes diagnosis data, treatment data, pharmacy data and
      sometimes clinical data such as lab data and other health data.<br />[0104]
      Applying the method of the instant protocol include necessary, sufficient, and
      elective operations--according to the &quot;reality&quot; of the current non-limiting
      example; and these operations include: Extracting the lists of participants
      in the Call Center Program and the Web-Site Program (names, addresses and other
      possible identifiable information); Providing a definition of control group.
      For example, all consumers who consume the manufacturer product but are not
      participants in either the Call Center Program or Web-Site Program; then Providing
      a definition of analysis required. For example, a mathematical definition for
      persistent usage of the pharmaceutical product, or total cost of healthcare
      consumed, or hospitalization cost, etc. Some analyses can be fairly complex
      and use other processes and patented methods such as ETG (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos.
      5,835,897 and 6,370,511B1); (Optional) Encrypting the lists using any industry
      grade encryption method; and Delivering the lists of participants together to
      a query engine with a capability to decrypt the lists at the time of processing
      (optional) to one or more healthcare organizations that store health transactions.
      Health plans tend to be mutually exclusive, meaning if a member belongs to any
      plan, that member typically belongs to that one plan only or is likely to consume
      similar service at a similar time from only one health plan. Therefore, this
      algorithm can be used--by repeating the same process with multiple health plans;
      and then simply summing the results from all health plans.<br />[0105] For each
      health plan: The query engine runs a &quot;fuzzy matching&quot; algorithm to
      match participants in the pharmaceutical health program with the health transactions
      at the healthcare organization; For all the matched users the query engine runs
      the analysis of their health transaction data to determine the result of the
      requested analysis (such as persistency of using the pharmaceutical product);
      The query engine runs the control group analysis for all users that were not
      matched but meet the control group definition (for example, users of the pharmaceutical
      product); and Aggregate the results to the following groups: Call Center Program
      participants only; Web-Site Program participants only; participants in both
      the Call Center Program and the Web-Site Program; Control group (for example,
      all consumers of the pharmaceutical product that are neither participants of
      the Call Center Program nor the Web-Site Program).<br />[0106] For each group
      provide the following result: Name of group, % participants matched with the
      healthcare organization health transaction data, and statistical result of all
      matched members (such as average persistency rate); The query engine determines
      whether the number of participants in each program and the % participants matched
      are above a level that ensures consumer individual privacy (based on a statistical
      definition). If not, the query engine responds with: group name &quot;cannot
      be analyzed because of privacy safeguards. Please try to define a bigger group
      of users&quot;; and the query engine output for each health plan is aggregated
      to provide an overall output that may be shared with the pharmaceutical manufacturer.<br
      />[0107] This instant protocol method offers valuable aggregate assessment of
      health programs based on objective health transaction data without disclosing
      identifiable personal health information. Most methods used today are based
      on &quot;soft measurements&quot; of value, such as activity-based measurements
      (people enrolled, number of interactions, etc.) and/or self-reported data (participants
      fill surveys or other questionnaire regarding their behavior). Objective measurement
      based on health transaction could become the gold-standard to measure such activities.<br
      />[0108] Most existing analytics services in healthcare are based on a model
      where patient-level health transactions are de-identified and then aggregated
      and processed for analysis. Clearly through this process, high-resolution raw
      data that includes the maximum amount of information is reduced to a lower resolution
      data to preserve privacy and possibly other interests. Many companies, including
      IMS Health, SDI (formerly Verispan, a joint venture between Quintiles and McKesson),
      Pharmetrics, Dendrite, Wolters Kluwer Health and others employ this model. This
      existing health analytics model may provide either physician level behavior
      or de-identified patient-level behavior and possibly a combination of both.
      However, while this model is very effective in analyzing longitudinal patient
      behavior and, in some cases, matching it to a known prescriber (such as physician),
      no linkage can be made to a consumer health program that only impact a subset
      of the market (unless the program correlates well with a limited region or cover
      a known group of physicians). One cannot query or analyze parameters that are
      no longer in the lower resolution dataset. Therefore, the existing healthcare
      analytics model does not provide the capability to aggregate the behavior of
      a group of patients by a predefined list of consumers participating in a health
      program. This is only one example of the limitations of the existing healthcare
      analytics model that is addressed by the instant protocol.<br />[0109] For the
      above described application of the instant protocol to be properly effective,
      access is needed to a combined health transaction data that is: (A) large enough
      to provide sufficient level of matching to address privacy concerns and to enable
      statistically significant analysis; and (B) to represent an approximation to
      the distribution of the general market as much as possible (regions, demographics,
      type of populations and type of insurances) or allow statistical correction
      based on pre known parameters. For example, if the data source, a specific health
      plan, includes 15M lives well distributed across the country and representative
      in every other aspect except that this particular health plan has a formulary
      that prefers particular pharmaceutical products over others, a statistical analysis
      could be used to &quot;correct&quot; that preference based on national analysis
      of formularies.<br />[0110] Recalling the health care related information system
      background factors of the background section, substantially, the instant protocol
      embodiment (the Crossix Method) is a method to enable the statistical measurement
      of one or more Health Programs and the compounded effect of combination of multiple
      Health Programs based on analysis of health transaction data while complying
      with Data Source Entity privacy regulations and Data Consumer Entity privacy
      policy.<br />[0111] By contrast, an example of &quot;classic&quot; model of
      health analytics calls for aggregation of de-identified patient-level or physician-level
      data which allow the central analysis model only (see FIGS. 1 &amp; 2). The
      common method used by existing healthcare analytics companies (such as IMS,
      Wolters Kluwer Health (formerly NDCHealth) and SDI (formerly Verispan) is based
      on the following steps: (A) De-identify &amp; Aggregate--patient data is de-identified
      (some data is removed or grouped together) and data is reported typically at
      the physician level. In some cases the dataset includes longitudinal de-identified
      patient-level data (such as Verispan and Dendrite) (B) Collect from various
      sources--data is collected from multiple healthcare organizations into a data
      warehouse (C) Analyze--syndicated data reports and custom studies are produced.<br
      />[0112] The instant Crossix &quot;method&quot; is based on an opposite sequence:
      (A) Analyze--the healthcare organization (such as health plan) runs an analysis
      software that receive as an input the required analysis and aggregation level
      as well as possibly a list of identifiable patients or physicians for which
      analysis is requested. This analysis is performed on the original, most complete
      data set; (B) De-identify &amp; Aggregate--Once name matching and analysis is
      complete data is aggregated and, if needed, de-identified; (C) and Collect from
      various sources--Analysis responses from multiple organization are composed
      to deliver the analyses requested.<br />[0113] Turning now to FIG. 9 and the
      double-blinded embodiment shown therein, an aggregator 900, via a user interface
      to the inventive system, formulates a query without having access to any privacy-sensitive
      data at one or more data consumer entities 910. (For clarity of illustration,
      data consumer entities 910 are shown as one box, rather than showing a separate
      box for each data consumer entity--but it should be understood that there can
      be one data consumer entity or a plurality of them.) In the case where data
      consumer entity 910 is a cable TV company, an example query might be &quot;all
      households who had the opportunity to see commercial advertising X between date
      A and date B&quot;. The objective of such a query is to link TV advertising
      viewership (i.e., exposure to an advertisement) to transactional purchasing
      information--to see, for example, how many households that saw a particular
      advertisement subsequently purchased the advertised product or service.<br />[0114]
      Aggregator 900 sends the query to one or more data consumer entities 910, and
      the data consumer entities 910 process the query by accessing their data and
      generating a list of specific instances that meet the conditions in the query.
      In the example case, the list would comprise specific households that saw advertising
      X between date A and date B. Data consumer entities 910 can either encrypt the
      list, using any suitable encryption method including without limitation a symmetrical
      key available to source-entities, public-private encryption keys, a one-way
      hash encryption applied to multiple combination of identifying fields supporting
      matching based on multiple values and other similar combination, or alternatively
      can choose not to encrypt the list. Data consumer entities 910 then send their
      encrypted or unencrypted lists directly to one or more data source entities
      920 for matching against transactional data, such as purchasing data. (For clarity
      of illustration, data source entities 920 are shown as one box, rather than
      showing a separate box for each data source entity--but it should be understood
      that there can be one data source entity or a plurality of them.) Alternatively,
      data consumer entities 910 can send their encrypted lists through aggregator
      900, in which case aggregator 900 forwards the lists to data source entities
      920. In this latter case, the information on the lists is kept confidential
      because the aggregator 900 does not have a decryption key which will decrypt
      it.<br />[0115] The matching is done using a matching algorithm similar to the
      one described for the single-blind embodiments, without necessarily providing
      access by data source entities 920 to a particular data consumer entity''s privacy-sensitive
      information. In other words, the data source entities can perform the matching
      on encrypted data received from data consumer entities 910 (in which case the
      Date Cruncher Module exemplified in FIG. 5 employs a decryption key), or on
      unencrypted data received from data consumer entities 910 (in which case the
      Date Cruncher Module exemplified in FIG. 5 does not need to employ a decryption
      key).<br />[0116] After matching, the matched individuals'' data (the results)
      are de-identified using methods and systems similar to those described earlier
      for the single-blind embodiments, and sent back to aggregator 900. Aggregator
      900 merges the results from data source entities 920 into one combined Final
      Analysis Result, using methods and systems similar to those described earlier
      for the single-blind embodiments, and sends the Final Analysis Result to the
      one or more data consumer entities 910.<br />[0117] FIG. 10 illustrates another
      double-blinded embodiment wherein instead of aggregator 900 generating the query,
      the data consumer entity 920 generates the query, and using its privacy-sensitive
      information, develops the list of specific instances (e.g., households) that
      meet the conditions of the query. As described in the FIG. 9 embodiment, data
      consumer entity 920 can encrypt the list in multiple ways before sending it
      directly to data source entities 920, or can send the list to data source entities
      920 unencrypted. Alternatively, data consumer entity 910 can send its encrypted
      list through aggregator 900, in which case aggregator 900 forwards the list
      to data source entities 920. Thus in this embodiment, aggregator 900 is not
      involved in generating the query on the front end of the process, but still
      aggregates the results from data source entities 920 into one combined Final
      Analysis Result and provides that result to data consumer entity 910.<br />[0118]
      FIG. 11 illustrates yet another double-blinded embodiment similar to FIG. 9,
      except that a separate data originator entity 930 provides the originating information,
      and thus aggregator 900 sends the query to data originator entity 930 and not
      to data consumer entity 910. Data originator entity 930 uses its information
      to generate a list of specific instances that meet the conditions in the query,
      optionally encrypts the list using any suitable encryption method including
      those previously described herein, and sends the list to data source entities
      920, either directly or through aggregator 900. (As in FIG. 9, data originator
      entities 930 are shown as one box, rather than showing a separate box for each
      data originator entity.) The other aspects of this embodiment match those of
      the FIG. 9 embodiment--for example, at the end of the process, data consumer
      entity 910 still receives the Final Analysis Result from aggregator 900.<br
      />[0119] FIG. 12 illustrates yet another double-blinded embodiment similar to
      FIG. 10, except that a separate data originator entity 930 provides the originating
      information, instead of data consumer entity 910. Data originator entity 930
      also formulates the query, uses its information to generate a list of specific
      instances that meet the conditions in the query, optionally encrypts the list,
      and sends the list to data source entities 920, either directly or through aggregator
      900. (As in FIG. 10, data originator entities 930 are shown as one box, rather
      than showing a separate box for each data originator entity.) The other aspects
      of this embodiment match those of the FIG. 10 embodiment--for example, at the
      end of the process, data consumer entity 910 still receives the Final Analysis
      Result from aggregator 900.<br />[0120] Final Notices Firstly, it should be
      appreciated that embodiments of the instant invention relate to the protocol
      as a whole, individually to respective aspects operating on an &quot;aggregator&quot;
      processor and on a &quot;source-entity&quot; processor; to specific configurations
      of computer readable software for allowing either processor to execute characterizing
      steps of the protocol, and to memory media having any of said software encoded
      therein; wherein the memory media includes physical media--such as magnetic
      or optical disks, read only memory and the likes, and to virtual media--such
      as downloadable execution code data transmission and the likes. Finally, while
      the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including
      presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the
      art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the
      above described systems and techniques that fall within the spirit and scope

      />[0003] The present invention generally relates to data privacy and data usage
      in distributed database systems--often belonging to disparate owners. More specifically,
      the present invention relates to coordination of data privileges while simultaneously
      preserving data privacy and allowing useful facilitation of privacy sensitive
      data features.<br />BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br />[0004] The worlds of database
      coordination, data rights and data usage are inherently paradoxical, since privacy
      preserving legal rights restrict usage of technical functions in some circumstances
      while permitting these same technical functions in other circumstances. Simply
      stated, usage of functions such as sort, search, merge, and Boolean logical
      operators are the pith and marrow of database operations--except when one of
      the database fields or a combination of several fields may lead to identification
      of a person.<br />[0005] Identifiable data may not be from one field and may
      not be that explicit. For example, a study done on the Census data in the US
      demonstrated that 87% of US population can be uniquely identified just based
      on Date-Of-Birth, Sex and ZIP code. There is also the issue of being able to
      re-identify someone based on an external public database (such as voter registration
      that includes DOB, Sex and ZIP). So bottom line, the real issue is the level
      uniqueness of a record and not necessarily a specific field. It is with this
      very concern in mind that data providers bundle their information goods into
      identity camouflaged collections or otherwise aggregate records or &quot;trim&quot;
      down the data to create more &quot;same&quot; records (e.g. report only the
      first three digits of a ZIP code or report only year of birth)--so that one
      cannot know, at a certain level of probability, if some particular John Doe
      is present in one category of an eventual statistical report or any specific
      details about him; even though this report is based on information goods where
      John Doe is explicitly labeled, quantitatively described and categorically characterized.<br
      />[0006] Numerous fields of endeavor come to mind wherein this data privacy
      paradox prohibits making best use of the information--especially for applications
      that are not concerned with any particular John Doe. For example, healthcare
      organizations such as physician practices, labs, hospitals and health maintenance
      organizations (HMOs) keep extensive medical records including data on each specific
      patient and on each specific doctor. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
      Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the USA and similar legislation in other jurisdictions
      prevents HMOs and healthcare providers from sharing data at full transparency--since
      the privacy of individuals must be preserved. (see FIGS. 1 &amp; 2 for further
      details) Nevertheless, without any interest in specific individuals, pharmaceutical
      companies could greatly improve many technical and mercantile aspects of their
      operation--if they were given unrestricted access to the HMO raw data. Similar
      data opacity exists between banks and insurance companies, between sellers of
      goods and credit card companies, between the census bureau and other government
      agencies (e.g. tax authorities, public health systems, etc.).<br />[0007] Just
      for example, the HIPAA related section talking about de-identification says:
      .sctn. 164.514 Other requirements relating to uses and disclosures of protected
      health information.<br />[0008] (a) Standard: de-identification of protected
      health information. Health information that does not identify an individual
      and with respect to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information
      can be used to identify an individual is not individually identifiable health
      information.<br />[0009] (b) Implementation specifications: requirements for
      de-identification of protected health information. A covered entity may determine
      that health information is not individually identifiable health information
      only if:<br />[0010] (1) A person with appropriate knowledge of and experience
      with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods for
      rendering information not individually identifiable: (i) Applying such principles
      and methods, determines that the risk is very small that the information could
      be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information,
      by an anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the
      information; and (ii) Documents the methods and results of the analysis that
      justify such determination; or<br />[0011] (2)(i) The following identifiers
      of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual,
      are removed: (A) Names; (B) All geographic subdivisions smaller than a State,
      including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent
      geo-codes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to
      the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic
      unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains
      more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for
      all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.
      (C) All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual,
      including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all
      ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age,
      except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category
      of age 90 or older; (D) Telephone numbers; (E) Fax numbers; (F) Electronic mail
      addresses; (G) Social security numbers; (H) Medical record numbers; (I) Health
      plan beneficiary numbers; (J) Account numbers; (K) Certificate/license numbers;
      (L) Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;
      (M) Device identifiers and serial numbers; (N) Web Universal Resource Locators
      (URLs); (O) Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers; (P) Biometric identifiers,
      including finger and voice prints; (Q) Full face photographic images and any
      comparable images; and (R) Any other unique identifying number, characteristic,
      or code; and (ii) The covered entity does not have actual knowledge that the
      information could be used alone or in combination with other information to
      identify an individual who is a subject of the information.<br />[0012] Again,
      specifically with reference to a non-limiting example of health care related
      information systems--it is worthy to note some additional Background Factors:<br
      />[0013] (A) The rising cost of health care--Health care expenses and utilization
      are growing at an alarming, unprecedented rate. In 2000 Americans spent $1.3
      trillion on health care. That''s more than was spent on food, housing, automobiles
      or national defense. And by 2010, health care expenditures are expected to double
      to $2.6 trillion--15.9 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, according to the
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. There are many reasons to the significant
      increase in cost. While addressing this challenge is a hot political, social
      and ethical issue, there is an agreement that healthcare information can be
      used to guide toward a more effective and efficient use of healthcare resources.<br
      />[0014] (B) The role of data in healthcare--analyses of adequate healthcare
      data can be used for a wide range of application including: identifying ways
      to improve the effectiveness, safety and efficiency of health care delivery;
      retrospective population studies to understand risk factors and therapeutic
      option; public health and epidemiological studies; the understanding of healthcare
      errors and compliance issues and the understanding of the effectiveness of healthcare
      innovations communication to healthcare professionals and consumers (healthcare
      marketing). Many of these applications contribute to a better and more efficient
      healthcare system.<br />[0015] (C) Health transaction data sources--healthcare
      claims data, transaction data and medical data is being created, stored and
      communicated by various healthcare organizations. Healthcare providers frequently
      initiate large amounts of data as they diagnose, perform various clinical tests,
      perform medical procedures, and prescribe treatment. Elements of the clinical
      information also exist with the laboratories, pharmacies, HMOs and other healthcare
      payers, as well as a range of other service organizations such as clearinghouses
      and PBMs. Health transaction data is protected by privacy standards such as
      the HIPAA in the USA. In many different areas of the healthcare system data
      is being used for both internal applications within the organization that generated
      the data or for external applications, by properly de-identifying transaction
      data from patient identifiers.<br />[0016] (D) Aggregated de-identified data,
      physician level--In the pharmaceutical industry data is commonly used to direct
      pharmaceutical companies promotional efforts. Pharmacy datasets are typically
      aggregated to the physician (or prescriber) level and include share and volume
      data (Total Rx and New Rx or TRx and NRx). In generating this datasets, the
      original identifiable and complete data is de-identified and aggregated and
      therefore a &quot;lower resolution&quot; of data is available as an output,
      or in other words a portion of the original dataset is lost and no longer available
      for analyses.<br />[0017] (E) Longitudinal patient-level data--A second-generation
      level of data is now also available for pharmaceutical applications. Frequently
      called anonymous (or de-identified) patient-level data, these datasets link
      several records of the same person over time, therefore providing better understanding
      of both consumers and physicians. These datasets never include identifiable
      patient information and sometimes also lack physician identifiers. In generating
      these datasets, the original identifiable and complete data is de-identified
      and aggregated and therefore a &quot;lower resolution&quot; of data is available
      as an output, or in other words a portion of the original dataset is lost and
      no longer available for analyses. In addition, at times methods such as one-way
      hash encryptions are used to be able to identify the same entity over time and
      across datasets. The use of constant one-way hash to link or match records for
      the same person or entity may have substantial drawbacks in terms of risk of
      downstream re-identification (e.g. access to the one-way hash and a set of personal
      information may allow generation of an individual''s encrypted identifier and
      therefore re-identification) as well as significantly reduced matching and/or
      linking capability.<br />[0018] (F) Direct-to-consumer, DTC as a trend--Specifically
      the pharmaceutical industry (and sometimes the medical device manufacturers),
      communicate directly with consumers to drive awareness to various medical conditions
      and to specific products. Direct-to-Consumer marketing has grown significantly
      since the FDA has relaxed its regulation on such activities in 1997. DTC initiatives
      range from advertising initiatives to initiatives that are very well targeted
      through a one-to-one dialog. Some initiatives are specifically aimed at users
      of a particular medication to encourage them to use the product correctly, or
      as prescribed, and for chronic conditions, encourage users to use the medication
      for a long period of time (persistency). DTC promotional activities are examples
      of Health Programs as defined herein.<br />[0019] (G) Adherence to therapies
      (compliance) as a major health issue--many healthcare stakeholders appreciate
      the need to enhance compliance to medical treatments prescribed by doctors.
      The World Health Organization published a study under the name &quot;Adherence
      to Long-Term Therapies: Evidence for Action&quot;. As part of the introduction
      to the study the WHO wrote--Adherence to therapies is a primary determinant
      of treatment success. Poor adherence attenuates optimum clinical benefits and
      therefore reduces the overall effectiveness of health systems. &quot;Medicines
      will not work if you do not take them&quot;--Medicines will not be effective
      if patients do not follow prescribed treatment, yet in developed countries only
      50% of patients who suffer from chronic diseases adhere to treatment recommendations.
      Improving compliance is one are that substantial more progress is needed with
      benefits to all healthcare stakeholders. Various sophisticated Health Programs,
      as defined herein, are launched by various sponsors with the goal of improving
      compliance.<br />[0020] (H) Nature of health programs and data collected; type
      of intervention and possible combinations--There are many different types of
      health programs and likewise different entities who may be interested in sponsoring
      and delivering these programs. Goals can vary based on sponsors (government,
      HMOs, employers, pharmaceutical companies, etc.). Health programs can have the
      goals of raising product awareness, acquiring new customers, encouraging patient
      compliance with medication regimen, expanding the overall diagnosed market,
      improve healthcare outcomes, improve quality of life, reduce overall cost to
      the healthcare system, etc. Other non-pharmaceutical manufacturer sponsored
      health programs may include public health efforts or disease/care management
      as well as other health promotion programs promoted by healthcare associations,
      payers and others.<br />[0021] (I) In-sufficiency of target consumer program
      measurement while data exist because of privacy issues--The challenge of measuring
      the impact of a consumer health program becomes significant whenever the health
      program sponsor does not have the full healthcare information of the target
      population at their disposal. Blocked by both access to data as well as privacy
      challenges, sponsoring organizations have to assess the impact of their efforts
      with very limited methods. As described above in this section, HIPAA provides
      substantial limitation on Personal Health Information and existing de-identification
      method may render the information useless for the purpose of measuring the impact
      of health programs. Naturally, with limited measurement abilities, less resources
      are directed by sponsors to valuable health programs such as compliance programs.<br
      />[0022] (J) &quot;Soft&quot; measurement of health programs, activity or self-reported
      measurement--As a result of the above mentioned limitations, existing methods
      for assessing health programs and marketing programs that effect a subset of
      the consumer/patient population include self reported data such as patient surveys
      or activity measurement such as the number of messages sent to the consumer,
      etc. Other approaches include: (i) consumer panels where consumers are surveyed
      on some regular basis. (ii) regionally or otherwise focused initiatives can
      be measured by a regional analysis if (iii) other fairly complex and limited
      methods to infer patient behavior.<br />[0023] Now, in these and countless other
      (non-health system related) examples, many useful advances to understanding
      would occur if the data privacy restrictions were lifted--since records could
      be aligned according to name and/or ID--thereby presenting to researchers a
      portrait of reality at substantially higher resolution. However, if this merger
      were allowed, then countless opportunities to breach personal privacy would
      occur in violations of laws and regulations--eventually causing many individuals
      to stop providing accurate information to their HMOs and healthcare providers,
      the census bureau, and/or to stop using their credit card, etc. Accordingly,
      there is a long felt need in the art for a protocol that will allow higher resolution
      query and manipulation of privacy sensitive data while simultaneously allowing
      individual privacy to be preserved. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider
      that any progress in the direction of better data utilization while maintaining
      privacy would constitute progress.<br />Key Definitions:<br />[0024] Data Source
      Entity--organizations that generate, capture or store (for example--in the health
      care industry) medical and claims data that includes identifiable personal health
      information. That includes physician office, hospitals, labs and other healthcare
      providers; pharmacies; and HMOs, MCOs, self-insured employers, insurance companies,
      PBMs and other such entities. It also includes claims clearinghouses and any
      other &quot;Covered Entities&quot; as defined under HIPAA. Conceptually, the
      source-entity also includes other entities operating as a vendor for the source-entity
      under a privacy agreement (such as HIPAA Business Associate Agreement). Furthermore,
      there are non-health care data source entities--such as credit card companies,
      credit bureaus, insurance companies, banks, the census bureau, social service
      agencies, law enforcement agencies, and the likes, all of which share common
      functionality as collectors and maintainers of myriads of data including therein
      personal identifiable data.<br />[0025] Data Consumer Entity--organizations
      that would like to get analytics services to answer marketing, operational,
      quality, (for example) health outcome or other business related question regarding
      a specific (for example) health program, initiative, a subset or all of the
      marketplace, etc. Data Consumer Entities are interested in strategic and tactical
      analyses to help them optimize their resource investment to achieve their objectives.
      Examples can be the government, researchers, product and service (for example)
      healthcare companies, etc. Specifically in healthcare, detailed population information
      can have a remarkable role in the identification of public health trends, retrospective
      health outcomes, clinical research and development, medical errors and other
      valuable healthcare applications.<br />[0026] Data Originator Entity--organizations
      that generate, capture or store personal identifiable data (&quot;originating
      information&quot;), from which can be generated a list of instances that satisfy
      a condition or conditions in a query. The query is related, of course, to the
      question that the Data Consumer Entity wants answered. Data Originator Entities
      can include health care organizations like physician offices, hospitals, labs
      and other healthcare providers, pharmacies, HMOs, MCOs, self-insured employers,
      insurance companies, PBMs, claims clearinghouses, and other such entities. Data
      Originator Entities can also include other entities operating as a vendor for
      the Data Source Entity under a privacy agreement. There are also non-health
      care Data Originator Entities, such as credit card companies, credit bureaus,
      MSOs, cable TV companies, insurance companies, banks, the census bureau, social
      service agencies, law enforcement agencies, and the like, all of which share
      common functionality as collectors and maintainers of data including therein
      personal identifiable data. The Data Originator Entity can be the same as the
      Data Consumer Entity (i.e., where the Data Consumer Entity has access to suitable
      originating information), or the two entities can be different (i.e., where
      the Data Consumer Entity does not have access to suitable originating information).<br
      />[0027] One example of a non-health care Data Originator Entity is a cable
      TV company with detailed records of household cable-box channel settings, household
      billing information and advertising schedules. The cable company information
      reveals what TV show or other entertainment content a particular household was
      watching at a particular time, and through this information it can be deduced
      which advertisements that particular household was exposed to. Such originating
      information is suitable for handling queries such as, but not limited to, &quot;all
      households who had the opportunity to see commercial advertising X between date
      A and date B&quot;. The objective of such a query is to link advertisement exposure
      to transactional purchasing information, in order to answer the question of
      a Data Consumer Entity (which might be a health care company, a consumer products
      company, etc.), concerning how many households that saw a particular advertisement
      subsequently purchased the advertised product or service.<br />[0028] Crossix--an
      expression that includes the instant protocol according to any of its embodiments--and
      derivative uses thereof (see FIGS. 4 &amp; 5 for preferred embodiment details)<br
      />[0029] Health Program--a program (used as specific example for the preferred
      embodiment of the instant invention) that affects a subset of the overall potential
      population. Typically patients, consumers or healthcare professionals will opt-in
      to participate in such a program and if the organization sponsoring it is not
      covered by HIPAA, the sponsoring organization will adhere to its published privacy
      policy. Typically Health Programs capture personal identifying information.
      Health Programs may include for example compliance programs or may include a
      broadcast advertising component (such as TV commercials) encouraging consumers
      to call a toll-free number or go to a web-site for further information. Frequently,
      at the call center or web-site, some consumer information is captured.<br />[0030]
      Typical Identifiable Data Captured in a Health Program--Some combination of
      the following fields or similar to those: First Name; Last Name; Date of Birth
      Or Year of Birth; Zip Code; Full Address; Phone Number(s); Fax Number(s); E-Mail;
      Prescribing Doctor Name, Address or Other Identifiers; Medical Condition or
      Drug Prescribed; Gender; Social Security. NOTE: Variability of data discussion--personal
      data frequently changes. (See discussion on this in U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,224
      and Math, Myth &amp; Magic of Name Search &amp; Matching by SearchSoftwareAmerica)
      A subset of this data jointly can serve as an identifier with high probability
      of uniqueness. For example, Date of Birth and phone number could serve jointly
      as unique identifiers. Data Source Entity information structure (of typical
      health care related identifiers) may include all or some of the above plus a
      unique member ID. (Note: See U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,044; U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,897
      and U.S. Pat. No. 6,370,511 for detailed description of healthcare data structure.)<br
      />ADVANTAGES, OBJECTS AND BENEFITS OF THE INVENTION<br />[0031] Ergonomic Issues:
      Preferred embodiments of the instant invention allow analysis of &quot;source-entity&quot;
      raw data at is original, most detailed form (high resolution data) including
      full access to all of the privacy sensitive data currently at its disposal while
      simultaneously maintaining existing privacy restrictions to the aggregator processor.
      In addition, high-resolution analysis may be performed at multiple different
      &quot;source-entities&quot; each of which preserves its privacy restrictions,
      yet under certain conditions the data can be aggregated by the aggregator processor
      to provide a more comprehensive analysis.<br />[0032] A number of different
      embodiments are described below, most of which involve the aggregator processor
      having access to the information at the data consumer entity or entities. However,
      another embodiment is also described below, wherein the aggregator processor
      does not have full access to the information at either the data consumer entity/entities
      or the data source entity/entities--because the information at both the data
      consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and the
      data source entity/entities are privacy-sensitive and may not be shared with
      the aggregator processor. Yet, in this latter embodiment the aggregator processor
      does have access to the matched and de-identified results of the query, so that
      the aggregator processor can analyze those results and deliver the final analysis
      result to the data consumer entity/entities. This latter embodiment, which can
      be thought of as a &quot;double-blinded&quot; embodiment because the aggregator
      processor is blind to both the privacy-sensitive information at the data consumer
      entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and the privacy-sensitive
      information at the data source entity/entities, has advantages in situations
      where the information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data
      originator entity/entities) is sensitive, and not even the aggregator should
      have exposure to it.<br />[0033] Economic Issues: Preferred embodiments of the
      instant invention allow exploitation of an order of magnitude more value potential
      from the data currently resident at the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors
      while only adding nominal expenses at the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor.
      Furthermore, expenses at the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor are essential
      to define and provide new avenues of access to the ensemble of privacy sensitive
      data located at the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors.<br />[0034] Technical
      Issues: Preferred embodiments of the instant invention essentially are composed
      of software packages that each respectively sit in different data processing
      machines where they interact with database packages on that respective machine
      or a machine connected to it via a network. The software packages are interconnected
      with each other using standard data-communications facilities (e.g. Internet,
      VPN, etc.). Accordingly, from a technical perspective, embodiments of the instant
      invention are convolutions of quasi-familiar software modules--allowing implementation
      to be straightforward in today''s data complexity environment.<br />SUMMARY
      OF THE INVENTION<br />[0035] The aforesaid longstanding needs are significantly
      addressed by embodiments of the present invention, which specifically relates
      to The Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol. The instant protocol is especially
      useful in society-computer interactions wherein there exist actual needs or
      economic benefits from allowing higher resolution query and manipulation of
      privacy sensitive data while simultaneously not allowing individual privacy
      to be breached.<br />[0036] Embodiments of the instant invention relate to a
      Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol, (see FIG. 3) operating between a secure
      &quot;aggregator&quot; data processor 300 and at least one secure &quot;source-entity&quot;
      data processors 350, wherein the &quot;aggregator&quot; and the &quot;source-entity&quot;
      processors are interconnected via an electronic data-communications topology
      399, and the protocol includes the steps of:<br />[0037] (A) on the side of
      the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor:<br />[0038] (i) from a user interface--accepting
      315 a query against a plurality of the predetermined attributes and therewith
      forming a parameter list,<br />[0039] (ii) via the topology--transmitting 320
      the parameter list to each of the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors,<br />[0040]
      (iii) via the topology--receiving 325 a respective file from each of the &quot;source-entity&quot;
      processors,<br />[0041] (iv) aggregating 330 the plurality of files into a data-warehouse,<br
      />[0042] (v) using the parameter list, extracting 335 query relevant data from
      the data-warehouse,<br />[0043] (vi) agglomerating 340 the extract, and<br />[0044]
      (vii) to a user interface--reporting 345 the agglomerated extract; and<br />[0045]
      (B) on the side of each processor of the at least one &quot;source-entity&quot;
      processors:<br />[0046] (i) accumulating 355 data-items wherein some of the
      data-items have privacy sensitive micro-data,<br />[0047] (ii) organizing 360
      the data-items using the plurality of predetermined attributes,<br />[0048]
      (iii) via the topology--receiving 365 a parameter list from the &quot;aggregator&quot;
      processor,<br />[0049] (iv) forming 370 a file by &quot;crunching together&quot;
      the data-items according to the parameter list,<br />[0050] (v) filtering out
      375 portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than
      a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data-items, and<br />[0051]
      (vii) via the topology--transmitting 380 the file to the &quot;aggregator&quot;
      processor.<br />[0052] After turning to FIGS. 4, 4A (a conceptually more detailed
      version of FIG. 4), and 5, let''s examine each of the sub-steps and explain
      what it accomplishes and how collectively it results in accomplishing an improvement
      over the aforesaid long felt need.<br />[0053] Embodiments of the Privacy Preserving
      Data-Mining Protocol are operating between a secure &quot;aggregator&quot; data
      processor--which is a central data processing machine--and at least one secure
      &quot;source-entity&quot; data processors--which are other data processing machines
      that respectively include records having privacy identified data such as name,
      identity number, or the likes. Until the present invention, it was the practice
      of the &quot;source-entity&quot; machines to query these records for internal
      use using the privacy identified fields--such as looking as an individual person''s
      records as a single unit, etc. However, it is generally legally prohibited for
      the &quot;source-entity&quot; to share and/or sell data having the privacy sensitive
      fields or fields that would allow correlation with other data whereby the privacy
      sensitive identifier could be &quot;guessed&quot;. Therefore, it has become
      common practice for &quot;source-entity&quot; data gatherers to condense their
      data around larger cluster variables--such as by age group or by state or by
      gender. While this practice preserves the privacy of individuals by dissolving
      their identity into an ensemble of others, it simultaneously precludes external
      researchers from benefiting from the richness of the &quot;source-entity&quot;
      data.<br />[0054] Now, the &quot;aggregator&quot; and the &quot;source-entity&quot;
      processors are interconnected via an electronic data-communications topology--such
      as the Internet, or a virtual private circuit or the likes; all of which eliminates
      any need for the processors to be collectively centralized. Rather, the processors
      may remain distributed, as is the case in today''s world. To summarize up to
      here, the protocol operates using data-communications facilities to interconnect
      a central aggregator processor with at least one source-entity processors. The
      source entity processors each have respective privacy sensitive data content
      along with other data content aspects.<br />[0055] Now, according to the instant
      protocol, on the side of the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor (A) there are
      seven sub-steps. First, a sub-step of &quot;(A-i) from a user interface--accepting
      a query against a plurality of the predetermined attributes and therewith forming
      a parameter list&quot; that establishes the aggregator as the focus of a query
      that may include problematic privacy-sensitive information that the source-entity
      cannot release to an &quot;outsider&quot;. Intrinsically, in the context of
      the instant invention, the parameters of the list may include identity disclosing
      specifics--which probably do not pass ordinary criteria of even nominal privacy
      thresholds, and/or broader variables--which probably do pass ordinary criteria
      of normal, rigid, or strict privacy thresholds.<br />[0056] These identity-disclosing
      specifics may be such things as name, personal identity number or simple data
      combinations that would allow breach of privacy if applies to disclose identity.
      What is important in the further application of the instant method is that these
      identity-disclosing specifics are part of a large enough list in the processing
      of a query so that the query result will present sufficient statistical distribution
      to protect the &quot;reverse engineering&quot; of the result back to any individual
      in the initial query list. For example, the instant method can ask about the
      status of Tom, Dick, Harry, and a further collection of individuals--and obtain
      results from that query--so long as the statistical character of those results
      will not allow correlation of a result specific back to an individual. Thus
      it may be that the query includes a list of 10,000 personal IDs and the results
      show that these individuals belong to group A with 60% probability, Group B
      with 25% probability, and one of Groups C-E with the remaining 15% probability.
      Accordingly, transmitting the parameter list may include transmitting a sufficiently
      large list of identity disclosing specifics.<br />[0057] Simply stated, the
      aggregator may accept a query that includes lots of identity specifics (e.g.
      a list of names or a combination of a few fields that together can allow identification)--the
      type of query that one does not expect to be answerable in any privacy preserving
      fashion. This sub-step essentially converts a model base postulate about the
      data (that relationships that the user wonders) into a formal language query
      phrases according to shared variable definitions mutually accepted by the aggregator
      and the source-entities. The parameter list would include a definition of the
      population to be analyzed such as by geography, age or other attributes. One
      of the most novel features of the instant protocol is that the parameter list
      may even include specific individuals by name or ID or the likes. It will simply
      be necessary that the number of the individuals in any population definition
      be large enough to dilute any definitive conclusion about an individual''s personal
      data into the &quot;sea&quot; of the group (of names'') data. According to some
      specific instant embodiments, all or part of the parameter list is encrypted.<br
      />[0058] Next, the sub-step of &quot;(A-ii) via the topology--transmitting the
      parameter list to each of the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors&quot; sends
      the formalized query--in whatever format is mutual agreed to by the aggregator
      with each respective source-entity. It may occur that the aggregator phrases
      the formal query differently to some source-entities than to other source-entities--and
      this is probably the most pragmatic embodiment. Sometime thereafter is the sub-step
      of &quot;(A-iii) via the topology--receiving a respective file from each of
      the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors&quot; whereby the aggregator receives
      some answer (or a null answer) from each source-entity; however (as we will
      understand from the source-entity side of the instant protocol) while the question
      included parameters which request that the source-entity correlate data according
      to privacy sensitive data aspects, the answer is condensed into an identity
      free representation.<br />[0059] For example, in the testing of an unusual postulate,
      the query asks to characterize patients who have a specific health problem and
      who receive a specific therapy in terms of the seniority of their attending
      physicians. In order to answer the query, the source entity must compare records
      with same patient names &amp; IDs to name &amp; ID specific physician records.
      However, the answer is a table of seniority brackets of physicians compared
      to a data cluster of multiple patients'' data. According to this type of example,
      a pharmaceutical company user could find out from a plurality of HMOs source-entity
      records if the company should market its therapy primarily to senior physicians
      or primarily to junior physicians, or both. Simply stated, the query test one
      possible postulate about the humanity of physicians--and that query has interesting
      economic implications for pharmaceutical companies.<br />[0060] Next, the sub-step
      &quot;(A-iv) aggregating the plurality of files into a data-warehouse&quot;
      goes further to protect privacy by bundling the responses of the individual
      source-entities into a large source-entity de-identified data collection and
      at the same time deliver results from multiple distributed and different data-sources.
      Thus, the sub-step &quot;(A-v) using the parameter list, extracting query relevant
      data from the data-warehouse&quot; allows for getting all the relevant data
      of the data warehouse to a single temporary collections including responses
      from one or more source-entity query-response cycles and other data which may
      come from the ordinary reporting of source-entities or others. Now, in sub-step
      &quot;(A-vi) agglomerating the extract&quot;, a condensed picture of all of
      the data which may uphold or reject the postulates of the query are summarized
      together; and finally in sub-step &quot;(A-vii) to a user interface--reporting
      the agglomerated extract&quot;.<br />[0061] Furthermore, (B) on the side of
      each processor of the at least one &quot;source-entity&quot; processors, the
      first two sub-steps call for ordinary operations--such as &quot;(B-i) accumulating
      data-items wherein some of the data-items have privacy sensitive micro-data,
      and (B-ii) organizing the data-items using the plurality of predetermined attributes&quot;.
      Thereafter, the sub-steps (B-iii) via the topology--receiving a parameter list
      from the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor&quot; let the source-entity begin
      to participate in the user initiated &quot;project&quot; that is being managed
      by the aggregator.<br />[0062] From here, the next sub-step &quot;(B-iv) forming
      a file by &quot;crunching together&quot; the data-items according to the parameter
      list&quot; causes each respective source-entity to perform the necessary internal
      data base queries and to perform the necessary correlations and formation of
      temporary data-interrelationships in order to know the local answer to all or
      part of the initial user query that was sent through the aggregator. If the
      parameter list included specific individuals by name or ID or the likes, &quot;Crunching
      together&quot; may involve name matching through &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; and
      other name matching algorithms of the population defined by the parameter list
      with the source-entity database names, in addition to the other steps defined
      above. Having done that, the sub-step &quot;(B-v) filtering out portions of
      the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined
      quantity of micro-data-specific data-items&quot; eliminates portions of the
      answer which might allow the user to guess the identity some data attribute--because
      that data attribute belongs to an individual or to a very small group of members.
      This step is necessary--since it eliminates one degree of trust from the relationship
      between the source-entity and the aggregator. In all good conscience, the source-entity
      has preserved his duty to protect the identity of individuals in his data collection.
      Simply stated, in the context of the instant invention, filtering is synonymous
      for implementing a privacy threshold at the &quot;source-entity&quot; level.
      In the HIPAA example, a certification by a statistician would set the allowed
      fields and required numerical levels to consider the results &quot;de-identified&quot;.
      Finally, to complete the protocol, there remains the sub-step of (B-vi) via
      the topology--transmitting the file to the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor&quot;
      is accomplished according to well-known methods in the art.<br />[0063] Reviewing
      the relationships between the user, the aggregator, and the source-entities,
      one notices that the user is permitted to phrase queries that may cause a source-entity
      to perform database functions requiring identity specific data--but this does
      not cause the identity, per se, to be revealed outside of the source-entity
      jurisdiction. Secondly, the aggregator may now collect and assemble identity
      protected reports from numerous data collections (source-entities) and assemble
      them into a single report--thereby potentially greatly increasing the statistical
      significance of conclusions that can be drawn from the aggregator report to
      the user. Furthermore, the very revealing aspect that all or most of the result
      may be coming from a single source-entity is protected. For example, it might
      be very politically sensitive to realize that attitudes of physicians in one
      HMO radically differ from physicians in all other HMOs--and this peculiarity
      may be hidden from the user by using an aggregator.<br />[0064] According to
      a first preferred embodiment of the instant invention, agglomerating the extract
      includes filtering out portions of the extract which characterize details particular
      to less than a predetermined quantity data-items. According to the preferred
      variation of this embodiment filtering out portions of the extract which characterize
      details particular to less than a predetermined quantity data-items includes
      the predetermined quantity being selected from the list, ordinal number, percentage
      of instances in the data-warehouse, data instances outside of mean plus predetermined
      number of standard distribution units.<br />[0065] According to a second preferred
      embodiment of the instant invention, agglomerating the extract includes filtering
      out portions of the extract so that only identity-free micro-data or identity-free
      aggregated data remains.<br />[0066] According to a third preferred embodiment
      of the instant invention, accepting a query includes performing a preprocessing
      privacy check against a predetermined source-entity data-ensemble model.<br
      />[0067] According to a fourth preferred embodiment of the instant invention,
      &quot;crunching together&quot; the data-items includes joining data-items having
      a mutual or similar micro-data-specific (for example similar names with variations
      such as nick name, prefix, suffix, etc.).<br />[0068] According to a fifth preferred
      embodiment of the instant invention, selected from the list of sub-steps aggregating,
      extracting, agglomerating, accumulating, organizing, and crunching, at least
      one sub-step includes fuzzy matching.<br />[0069] According to a sixth preferred
      embodiment of the instant invention, (on the source-entity processor side) filtering
      out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than
      a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data-items includes selecting
      the predetermined quantity from the list, an ordinal number, a percentage of
      instances in the data-warehouse, data instances outside of statistical mean-or-median
      plus-and/or-minus a predetermined number of standard deviation units.<br />[0070]
      According to a seventh preferred embodiment of the instant invention, accepting
      a query includes transforming the query into a standardized query--capable of
      resulting in a syndicated reporting of the agglomerated extract. In this context,
      it is preferred that, a Markup Language be used which directly links aspects
      of the query with aspects of the reporting--since it is anticipated that various
      industries will adopt the instant protocol to produce substantially real-time
      &quot;testimonies&quot;.<br />[0071] Some collateral embodiments of the instant
      invention relate to (see FIG. 6) a program storage device 600 readable by machine,
      tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform
      method steps for &quot;aggregator&quot; data processor functions in a Privacy
      Preserving Data-Mining Protocol, said method steps including: (i) from a user
      interface--accepting 610 a query against a plurality of the predetermined attributes
      and therewith forming 620 a parameter list, (ii) via an electronic data-communications
      topology--transmitting 630 the parameter list to at least one &quot;source-entity&quot;
      processors, (iii) via the topology--receiving 640 a respective file from each
      of the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors, (iv) aggregating 650 the plurality
      of files into a data-warehouse, (v) using the parameter list, extracting 660
      query relevant data from the data-warehouse, (vi) agglomerating 670 the extract,
      and (vii) to a user interface--reporting 680 the agglomerated extract.<br />[0072]
      Other collateral embodiments of the instant invention relate to (see FIG. 7)
      a program storage device 700 readable by machine, tangibly embodying a program
      of instructions executable by the machine to perform method steps for secure
      &quot;source-entity&quot; data processor functions in a Privacy Preserving Data-Mining
      Protocol, said method steps including: (i) accumulating 710 data-items wherein
      some of the data-items have privacy sensitive micro-data, (ii) organizing 720
      the data-items using the plurality of predetermined attributes, (iii) via an
      electronic data-communications topology--receiving 730 a parameter list from
      an &quot;aggregator&quot; processor, (iv) forming 740 a file by &quot;crunching
      together&quot; the data-items according to the parameter list, (v) filtering
      750 out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than
      a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data-items, and (vi) via the
      topology--transmitting 760 the file to the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor.<br
      />[0073] Notwithstanding the aforesaid, general embodiments of the instant invention
      (see FIG. 8) relate to a Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol 800, substantially
      as herein before described and illustrated, firstly characterized by having
      at least one of mutually independent secure &quot;source-entity&quot; data processors
      810 respectively forming 820 a file by &quot;crunching together&quot; data-items
      according to a parameter list, and thereafter respectively filtering 830 out
      portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined
      quantity of micro-data-specific data-items; and secondly characterized by having
      a secure &quot;aggregator&quot; data processor 850 aggregating 860 the plurality
      of files into a data-warehouse. Furthermore, other variation embodiments of
      the instant protocol are bi-directional--meaning that the fundamental relationship
      between the &quot;source-entity&quot; and &quot;aggregator&quot; processors
      is reversed and/or reversible!<br />[0074] Thus, it is accurate to summarize
      that the fundamental embodiments of the Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol
      of the instant invention operate between a secure &quot;aggregator&quot; data
      processor and at least one secure &quot;source-entity&quot; data processors.
      The &quot;aggregator&quot; and the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors are
      interconnected via an electronic data-communications topology. The protocol
      is characterized by including the data-communications coordinated steps of:
      the at least one mutually independent secure &quot;source-entity&quot; data
      processors respectively forming a file by &quot;crunching together&quot; data-items
      according to a parameter list, and thereafter respectively filtering out portions
      of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined
      quantity of micro-data-specific data-items; and the secure &quot;aggregator&quot;
      data processor aggregating the plurality of files into a data-warehouse.<br
      />[0075] Embodiments of the protocol of the instant invention are applicable
      to many arms-length data rights relationships, including (for example) those
      that exist between healthcare providers, pharmacies, PBMs or Health Maintenance
      Organizations (HMOs) &amp; Pharmaceutical-Companies; electronic commerce &amp;
      market research; banking &amp; insurance; census bureau &amp; other government
      agencies; auditors &amp; independent procurement/service organizations; and
      the likes.<br />[0076] A further class of embodiments of the Privacy Preserving
      Data-Mining Protocol of the present invention is worthy of note; and these are
      interim data merger enabled embodiments. Simply stated, these embodiments allow
      for the linkage of data items as related to a common entity. For example, an
      individual was a regular member of a first health care medical expense insurance
      plan and then switched to become a member of a second health care medical expense
      insurance plan. If the data sources are careful to encrypt the identifying portions
      of each record using a common encryption &quot;key&quot;, then further down
      the data processing circuit it will be possible to link records related to a
      common individual without compromising the identity of that individual. Of course,
      special care must be taken that the entity performing the linkage is not capable
      of knowing the key and decryption function; because knowing these facets would
      enable a breach of the individual''s privacy. (Note: U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,224
      considered some aspects of using third party key holding to respect individual
      privacy--albeit without facilitating anonymous linkages between a plurality
      of data records.)<br />[0077] Returning now to FIGS. 3 and 8 (and Mutatis Mutandis
      to their respective program storage devices), it can now be appreciated that
      there are numerous locations where an encryption of individual identification
      and/or merger of data for individuals could be facilitated. By way of non-limiting
      example, on the &quot;aggregator&quot; processor side, the encryption and/or
      merger could be enable during the sub-steps: receiving a respective file, or
      aggregating the plurality of files; or on the &quot;source-entity&quot; processors''
      side, the encryption and/or merger could be enabled during the sub-steps: organizing
      the data-items, forming a file, or filtering out portions of the file.<br />[0078]
      Thus there are at least two different situations where data from the data source
      is returned already aggregated, after analysis as well as a second option where
      data is release at the micro-level (each person''s data), but the person identity
      information, for the matched population, is replaced with a unique encryption
      key, such as a one way hash or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or the likes.
      This compatible encryption for the identifying micro-level data preserves the
      ability to know that the two records belong to the same identity, but preserve
      the privacy of the identity of that person. Each situation has viable options,
      albeit with respectively different advantages and disadvantages.<br />[0079]
      According to the preferred variation of this interim data merger enabled class
      of embodiments, the ability to link micro-level records related to the same
      identity at the data aggregator level is preserved--even if the records came
      from two different data sources.<br />[0080] Recall, at substantially each data
      source there is performed a name matching to identify all of the records for
      a certain identity (e.g. for Jane Doe). In that identity matching, the result
      may be several combinations of personal identifiers for the same person--for
      example (Jane Doe, (Boston, Mass.), health-plan ID 1234) and (Jane Doe, (New
      York, N.Y.) health-plan ID 5678) may both appear in a single data source. Since
      the name matching preferably has &quot;fuzzy logic&quot;, the software in the
      data source will find both. When releasing data from the data source to the
      data aggregator, the personal IDs will be encrypted--but using the same key
      in all data sources--a key that will preferably not be known to the Crossix
      protocol operator, but only a trusted third party such as an escrow agent. Now
      assume that a second data source also had data for (Jane Doe, (New York, N.Y.)
      health-plan ID 5678).<br />[0081] Now, at the data aggregator, data will be
      received from each data source, and the desire is to know that one instantiation
      with variation of Jane Doe is the same as another for a second data source.
      The way to achieve that is to encrypt more than a single ID for each person--so
      in the data released from the first data source--we will get both keys and the
      healthcare data (WXYZ (key1), ABCD (key2), other de-identified healthcare data)
      and from the second data source we will get (WXYZ, other de-identified healthcare
      data). Because of the fact that we encrypt several key that can uniquely identify
      the person, we can link their healthcare record for a more complete analysis.
      For example, if a person filled a prescription in one pharmacy, took a job with
      another employer (and therefore received a new health plan ID) but still used
      the same pharmacy, and eventually moved to another city; then, using the current
      merger embodiment, one could analyze whether that person is compliant and persistent
      in refilling the prescription for his medication (an important healthcare datum
      for that person)--even though the identity of that person is not knowable to
      the analyzer.<br />[0082] Thus, it should be apparent to the ordinary man of
      the art that the afore-mentioned interim data merger enabled embodiments and
      the likes are essentially elaborations of various imbedded encryption strategies
      for micro-data and their respective potential advantages--all in the context
      of the instant Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol.<br />Notices<br />[0083]
      The present invention is herein described with a certain degree of particularity,
      however those versed in the art will readily appreciate that various modifications
      and alterations may be carried out without departing from either the spirit
      or scope, as hereinafter claimed.<br />[0084] For example, every step requiring
      a transmitting of data (or of at least one file) and every respective associated
      step requiring receiving of that data (or of that at least one file) may preferably
      include respective encryption and decryption--however the nature and quality
      of this security aspect is well understood by the systems administrator; in
      the context of his specific regulatory environment, etc. Nevertheless, it is
      generally preferable to include some degree of data transmission security. (Compliant
      with this rationale, process occurring in processors of running the instant
      protocol should be secure--and certified as such.)<br />[0085] Another example
      relates to applications of the instant protocol, in that it is anticipated that
      countless examples of privacy preservation may be achieved between heretofore
      strictly separated entities (&quot;a query relationship&quot;)--such as pharmaceutical
      companies and HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), market researchers and
      credit card companies, government agencies and the census bureau, Law Enforcement
      Agencies seeking to understand general aspects of a social problem (as recorded
      in countless private data-banks) without needing a search warrant for any specific
      individual or class or individuals, and similar heretofore detail-opaque query
      and answer data opportunities. Thus, it is anticipated that at least one of
      an at least two electronic data providers is selected from the list: data source
      entity, data consumer entity, health program, pharmaceutical manufacturer/distributor,
      public health regulator/monitor; credit card bureau, market research organization,
      banking consortium, census bureau, government agency, or the likes.<br />[0086]
      A further example, relates to the inclusion of at least a predetermined minimum
      number of individuals (identified by name or ID, address, phone number, date
      of birth, e-mail or the likes or a combination thereof) into a &quot;parameter
      list&quot; (that is formed or transmitted in the instant protocol)--and these
      individuals may be persons or legal entities or individual motor vehicles or
      individual computers or serial numbering industrial products or legal registration
      numbers or license numbers or the likes. Returning to the above-mentioned aspects
      of preferable encryption, it is certainly strongly advised that regardless of
      the general level of encryption elected, a parameter list including &quot;individuals&quot;
      should carry a stronger level of encryption. Nevertheless, in each &quot;query
      relationship&quot; there are different legal standards which may be applicable--such
      as in health care in the USA, interim between-party results must be HIPAA (Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) de-identified without
      micro-data specific content or substantially equivalently provably statistically
      intractable.<br />[0087] Thus, in describing the present invention, explanations
      are presented in light of currently accepted Data-Processing theories and Legal-Privacy
      models. Such theories and models are subject to quantitative (computational)
      &amp; qualitative (cultural) changes, both adiabatic and radical. Often these
      changes occur because representations for fundamental component elements are
      innovated, because new transformations between these elements are conceived,
      or because new interpretations arise for these elements or for their transformations.
      Therefore, it is important to note that the present invention relates to specific
      technological actualization in embodiments. Accordingly, theory or model dependent
      explanations herein, related to these embodiments, are presented for the purpose
      of teaching, the current man of the art or the current team of the art, how
      these embodiments may be substantially realized in practice. Alternative or
      equivalent explanations for these embodiments may neither deny nor alter their
      realization.<br />[0088] A further embodiment of the present invention is shown
      in FIGS. 9 and 10. In this embodiment, the aggregator processor does not have
      access to the information at either the data consumer entity/entities (and/or
      the data originator entity/entities) or the data source entity/entities. This
      embodiment can be thought of as &quot;double-blinded&quot; because the aggregator
      processor is blind to both the privacy-sensitive information at the data consumer
      entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and the privacy-sensitive
      information at the data source entity/entities. Yet, the aggregator processor
      does have access to the matched and de-identified results of the query, so that
      the aggregator processor can analyze those results and deliver the final analysis
      result to the data consumer entity/entities. In contrast, the other embodiments
      can be thought of as &quot;single-blinded&quot; because the aggregator processor
      is blind to the privacy-sensitive information at the data source entity/entities,
      although the aggregator does have access to the information at the data consumer
      entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) despite its privacy-sensitive
      nature.<br />[0089] The double-blinded embodiment is used in situations where
      the information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator
      entity/entities) is sensitive, and not even the aggregator should have exposure
      to it. A good example of such a situation is where the data consumer entity
      is a cable TV company that has detailed records (possibly second-by-second)
      of household cable-box channel settings, household billing information and advertising
      schedules (i.e., which ads were broadcasted on what channel at what time). In
      other words, the cable company information reveals what TV show or other entertainment
      content a particular household was watching at a particular time, and through
      this information it can be deduced which advertisements that particular household
      was exposed to. The cable company''s information is privacy sensitive and can
      not be released to the aggregator as is, because it contains the family name,
      their address, or other identifying indicia along with information about the
      family''s viewing habits that the family may not wish to be known. Indeed, the
      cable TV company may also wish the viewing habits of specific families to remain
      private, in order to avoid the negative publicity should it become known that
      the cable TV company did not keep such information private.<br />[0090] Other
      examples of data consumer entities that potentially have privacy-sensitive information
      which cannot be revealed to the aggregator include credit card companies, airline
      companies, auto rental companies, publisher and online media companies as well
      as healthcare companies such as pharmacies, hospitals and managed care organizations.
      When a healthcare company is the data consumer entity, the need to keep its
      information private from even the aggregator is particularly acute, since various
      laws and regulations including HIPAA may require complete privacy.<br />[0091]
      Another reason the information at the data consumer entity could be privacy-sensitive
      is that it may not even be the data consumer entity''s own information. Instead,
      the information may be acquired by the data consumer entity from a third party
      who requires that the information be kept private. Or, this &quot;originating
      information&quot; may not be available to the data consumer entity at all, and
      may instead be provided by a data originator entity who is a third party unconnected
      with the data consumer entity. This latter situation is shown in FIGS. 11 and
      12, and is exemplified by the following situation: let''s say the data consumer
      entity is a pharmaceutical company that wishes to have a certain business question
      answered. The pharmaceutical company does not have access to originating information,
      and the originating information is instead provided by a third party--for example
      a cable TV company--with suitable information that can generate a list of specific
      instances which meet the conditions in the query. In this situation, the data
      consumer entity is not involved in generating the list at the front end of the
      process. However, the data consumer entity of course still receives the analysis
      results from the aggregator at the back end of the process, so that the data
      consumer entity''s business question is answered.<br />[0092] It should also
      be understood that the situation discussed above, wherein the data consumer
      entity does not have access to any or all of the originating information, and
      at least some of the originating information is instead provided by a third
      party--a &quot;data originator entity&quot;--with suitable information that
      can generate a list of specific instances which meet the conditions in the query,
      can also exist for the single-blinded embodiments described herein. Said another
      way, the situation wherein a separate data originator entity (not the data consumer
      entity) supplies the originating information can exist in cases where the originating
      information can be shared with the aggregator, and cases where it cannot.","backgroundTextHtml":"CROSS-REFERENCES
