# v3 to v4 Migration Guide

If you are migrating from v3 to v4, there are a few things to be aware of:

1. The .json configuration method is no longer supported. You must use environment variables to change patent_client settings.
2. Model fields may have moved around. This new version has less data normalization across the API's than v3.
