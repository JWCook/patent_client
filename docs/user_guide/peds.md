# US Patent Examination Data System (PEDS)

Original API URL: <https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/>

:::{warning}
The PEDS interface is under active development by the USPTO. Occasionally documented filtering
and ordering criteria will fail. Failed filters return no results. Failed ordering critera just
have no effect.

:::{warning}
Downloading file history documents currently doesn't work. The downloader now raises an appropriate
error to indicate this problem. This warning will be removed when downloading works reliably again
:::

:::{warning}
The PEDS interface will be DEPRECATED in late 2024 in favor of [Open Data Portal](../open_data_portal.md).
See [the ODP FAQs](https://beta-data.uspto.gov/support/faq) for more information.

Patent Client provides an interface to the USPTO Patent Examination Data System (PEDS).


PEDS is a REST-ful API that contains all the publicly available data in Patent Center (formerly PAIR).
It provides a wealth of bibliographic information on pending and issued US Patent applications, as well as PCT
applications filed with the USPTO as the Receiving oFfice. Because of this, the models returned by the USApplications API are quite complex with lots of nested data fields (e.g. transaction data, continuity data, inventors, etc.)
Use it like this:

```python
>>> from patent_client import USApplication
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> app = USApplication.objects.get('14591909')
>>> app.patent_title
'Integrated Docking System for Intelligent Devices'
>>> app.app_filing_date
datetime.date(2015, 1, 7)

```

## Querying

There are also lots of filtering options, which make this interface great for patent
portfolio analysis. For example:

```python
>>> apps = USApplication.objects.filter(first_named_applicant='Caterpillar')
>>> len(apps) > 4000
True
>>> pprint(apps[:5].to_list())
[USApplication(appl_id='...', patent_title='...', app_status='...'),
 USApplication(appl_id='...', patent_title='...', app_status='...'),
 USApplication(appl_id='...', patent_title='...', app_status='...'),
 USApplication(appl_id='...', patent_title='...', app_status='...'),
 USApplication(appl_id='...', patent_title='...', app_status='...')]

```

A complete list of available filters can be found by calling `USApplication.objects.fields`.
